    "about_project": "CareerBuilder.AI is a personal career guidance web app I built as part of an internship project. The goal was to create a platform that analyzes a user’s resume, understands their target role, and then generates a personalized skill roadmap to help them grow. I used Next.js with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS for the UI, and session/local storage for persistence. The project evolved from a simple two-mode app (resume vs fresh start) into a unified intelligent flow where users can upload a resume and choose a goal — and the app bridges the gap in between.\n\nThere were breakthroughs: building a visual roadmap dashboard, making a circular progress ring work smoothly, and integrating contextual AI feedback. There were bugs: session data vanishing mid-flow, DOM rendering quirks, and layout shifts from hidden overflows. And there were brain-fry moments — like debugging context not syncing across sections, or fine-tuning AI prompts to give structured, helpful output.\n\nThe final product is smart, interactive, and genuinely useful — and building it taught me more about UX, flow, and front-end problem-solving than any tutorial ever could.",
    "about_adobe": "My internship journey was honestly one of the most exciting and chaotic learning curves I’ve had. From building real features that people could actually use to breaking them five minutes later, every day brought something new. I really enjoyed the freedom to experiment, the feedback loops with mentors, and those random “aha!” moments when something finally clicked at 2 AM. The most unforgettable moment? Accidentally breaking the entire dashboard layout during a demo and fixing it just seconds before the mentor joined — pure adrenaline, but also pure growth."

    "about_project": "NutriAI is a smart nutrition assistant we built to tackle one of today’s most overlooked challenges—maintaining a balanced diet tailored to individual needs. The idea was to let users simply describe their dietary goals or preferences in plain language, and the system would return personalized meal suggestions, nutritional insights, and grocery recommendations. One of the biggest challenges was extracting recipes from AI through APIs based on user information ; early on, the model either overgeneralized or got too rigid. We spent a lot of time refining the prompt parsing logic and setting up a flow that balanced personalization with practicality. There were moments when nothing worked as expected—calorie mismatches, buggy ingredient substitutions, or meals with wildly off nutrition stats—but each bug pushed us closer to understanding how to make the system more reliable. The breakthrough came when we integrated a feedback loop allowing the system to learn and adjust based on user inputs. It turned NutriAI from just another diet app into a more intuitive companion. This project tested both our technical skills and design thinking, and it was deeply rewarding to see it evolve into something both smart and user-friendly.",
    "about_adobe": "My internship at Adobe India was nothing short of amazing! From day one, the atmosphere felt energetic, collaborative, and full of learning opportunities. I got to work on real-world problems, explore creative tech solutions, and interact with some truly inspiring mentors. One thing I really enjoyed was how open and helpful everyone was—whether it was debugging an issue or brainstorming ideas over coffee breaks. My most unforgettable moment was when I presented my first working prototype during my project demo, and seeing it get appreciated by senior folks gave me a huge confidence boost! It felt like all those late nights and “why isn’t this working?!” moments were totally worth it. This journey not only sharpened my technical skills but also made me feel more confident as a contributor in the tech space.\n\n"

    "about_project": "\nFor my final capstone project, I had to rebuild the food ordering website I previously made during my mini capstone — this time using **Adobe Edge Delivery Services (EDS)**. The goal was to compare traditional development with EDS: how the approach differs, how easy or difficult it is to build and maintain, and how it impacts the **Lighthouse score** and overall site speed.\n\nGetting started with EDS wasn’t easy. It was a completely new way of working — using blocks, authoring content through Google Docs, and previewing through Sidekick took some getting used to. On top of that, making sure the site stayed fast and optimizing the Lighthouse score added to the initial challenge. But after a few days of exploring, trying things out, and making mistakes, I began to understand how it all fits together.\n\nOnce I got the hang of it, building the site became smoother and more intuitive. I could see the benefits of modular development, faster load times, and how clearly content and code were separated. This experience helped me learn a more scalable, efficient way of developing websites and gave me a solid comparison to the traditional approach.\n",
    "about_adobe": "When I joined on the very first day, stepping into the corporate world was a completely new experience for me. Everything felt fresh and different from the professional environment to how communication worked in teams. Initially, I had the habit of addressing everyone as \"sir\" or \"ma'am\", but gradually I adapted and became more comfortable in this dynamic space. Over the course of my journey, I met a lot of wonderful people, made new friends, and connected with mentors who guided me patiently. I learned not just about work, but also about collaboration, communication, and what it means to grow in a professional environment. Along the way, I created valuable memories filled with learning, laughter, and joy. One personal milestone was going to the gym for the first time in my life ,right here at Adobe, with friends who made the experience both fun and motivating.\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed the various events and activities that happened during my time here. I had the opportunity to participate in the cricket tournament, where we made it to the semi-finals — a proud moment for me was defending 7 runs in the last over of the quarter-finals, something I’ll always cherish. At the community fair, I stacked 19 shuttlecocks on top of each other and came second in the cycling club’s challenge ,small wins, but full of excitement and fun. The Alchemy event was also a special highlight. The food, too, was something I looked forward to  .\n\nBeyond these experiences, I also had the chance to dive deep into the world of UI development. I learned the foundational principles of user interface design, how developers think about structure, accessibility, and performance. My journey into Edge Delivery Services (EDS) helped me understand modern web architecture and how it compares with conventional approaches. I explored concepts like modular blocks, Google Docs-based authoring, and Sidekick previews, which opened my eyes to how scalable and efficient content delivery can be. I also learned how to analyze and improve Lighthouse scores, and why these metrics — like performance, accessibility, and SEO — are critical for real-world web experiences. This technical exposure helped me bridge the gap between design and development and strengthened my confidence as a budding frontend developer."

I developed a user-friendly interface that allowed managers to search consultants via LDAP and filter them by manager to view detailed monthly and quarterly attendance summaries. One of the tricky bugs involved ensuring accurate filtering from SharePoint lists, especially with varied date entries and choice fields. A breakthrough came when I implemented a bulk attendance entry feature using a date range, which drastically cut down manual input time. I also integrated Power Automate to enable one-click Excel report downloads, pulling structured data from SharePoint and saving it to OneDrive in a clean, ready-to-share format. There were definitely brain-fry moments, especially while dealing with delegation warnings and aligning Power Apps logic with Power Automate flows. But in the end, the solution delivered measurable efficiency, better visibility for managers, and an overall smoother attendance process.",

One of my most unforgettable moments was the first time my Excel report download flow worked perfectly—after hours of trial and error, seeing it finally succeed felt amazing! I also made some really great friends among the other interns, and bonding over our shared experiences made the journey even more memorable. This internship not only helped me grow technically but also gave me lasting connections and confidence in my skills."

Her ability to integrate Workfront APIs into the NodeJs application demonstrates strong potential. She consistently seeks to deepen her understanding and applies new concepts effectively. I am confident that her completed capstone project will showcase the skills and knowledge she has gained during her training.",
    "about_project": "My internship project aimed to simplify Adobe Workfront’s experience for occasional users by creating a streamlined portal with essential functionalities like raising requests, submitting issues, uploading documents, and viewing tasks or approvals. The goal was to reduce complexity and avoid the steep learning curve of the full Workfront interface, especially for users who only need to perform basic actions.\n\nOne major challenge was dynamically fetching request queues and custom forms from Workfront using its API. It required understanding the exact API structure and managing token-based authentication, which often failed due to expiration or incorrect scopes. Another tough moment was integrating AEM Assets for document uploads — handling file size limits, metadata, and ensuring secure service credentials took several trials.\n\nA big breakthrough came when the entire request form flow—from fetching request types to submitting user input—was successfully connected with Workfront’s backend. Seeing data appear in the actual Workfront instance was incredibly satisfying. However, the experience sharpened my problem-solving skills and deepened my understanding of real-world API integrations and enterprise-level tools.\n\n\n\n",
    "about_adobe": "My internship journey at Adobe has been an exciting blend of learning, challenges, and growth. I really enjoyed exploring how enterprise tools like Workfront and AEM work behind the scenes.I also loved the fun team catch-ups, where we’d mix work talk with random conversations, making the experience feel less like work and more like a collaborative adventure"

    "about_project": "Omnis AI is an intelligent web application designed to optimize and elevate user interaction with Adobe Experience Platform (AEP). The name “Omnis,” derived from Latin meaning “all,” reflects our commitment to delivering a holistic solution for automating AEP tasks. By integrating Generative AI capabilities, Omnis AI empowers users to work more efficiently and achieve their goals with enhanced precision and speed.\n\nDuring development, one of the biggest challenges was implementing secure and scalable multi-organization support. We used AWS Cognito with custom attributes (custom:orgs) to associate users with multiple organizations and built a dynamic organization dropdown in the UI to reflect this. Connecting the frontend (React) with the backend (AWS Lambda via API Gateway) led to multiple CORS-related issues, requiring careful debugging of headers and preflight configurations.\n\nAnother complex task was syncing user authentication, signup, and org registration flows, all while maintaining a clean and responsive UI. There were several \"brain-fry\" moments—like debugging broken axios calls and handling nested attribute updates in Cognito—but each breakthrough taught us more about cloud architecture, security, and UI/backend synchronization. Overall, Omnis AI helped sharpen our full-stack development and serverless design skills significantly.",
    "about_adobe": "My internship journey has been an amazing blend of learning, growth, and fun.

But my most unforgettable moment has to be attending “Alchemy,” the special program for interns—it was such a refreshing break filled with fun activities, great vibes, and of course, amazing food! I absolutely loved spending time in the cafeteria, enjoying the variety of snacks and meals (yes, I looked forward to lunch every day 🤭). I also enjoyed playing games with my new friends during free time. This internship didn’t just teach me tech—it gave me memories and friendships I’ll always cherish."

    "about_project": "During my internship, I built a conversational AI assistant to streamline Adobe Experience Platform (AEP) schema creation. The assistant interprets natural language to identify the correct XDM class, field groups (both standard and custom), identity fields, and then generates valid AEP schema payloads—automagically. I worked extensively with LangChain, Azure OpenAI (GPT-4), function calling, and tool-based agents to orchestrate multi-step logic and dynamic tool selection. The backend was developed in Python, and I integrated Adobe’s Schema Registry API to fetch and manipulate real schema components using GET, PATCH, and POST calls. Bugs? Oh, there were plenty. From infinite recursive tool calls (because the agent developed short-term memory loss) to complex field group merging logic that refused to cooperate, the debugging sessions were intense. But breakthroughs like modularizing the payload generator, validating schema JSONs, adding PATCH support, and dynamically suggesting field groups made it all worth it. I also used Requests, Pydantic, and thread-safe caching to optimize response time and data integrity. Overall, the project pushed me deep into conversational UX, platform integration, and API-first thinking—and taught me how to keep my cool when Adobe spits out a 400.",
    "about_adobe": "This internship was insane in the best way possible. I got to explore bleeding-edge agentic tools like LangChain, the latest OpenAI APIs, AWS lambda functions and Adobe AEP... and also discovered that bugs multiply when you stare at them. I loved the creative freedom, the mentorship, and that magical moment when the chatbot finally stopped hallucinating and started actually building usable schemas. My most unforgettable moment? When my code worked perfectly during a live demo even though it hadn’t all morning—and I had to pretend that was totally planned. I also may have committed files to the wrong branch more times than I’d like to admit. But hey, version control is character-building, right? Between late-night debugging marathons, team banter, and that sweet dopamine rush of pushing clean code, this internship gave me skills, confidence, and a whole new level of appreciation for well-documented APIs."
